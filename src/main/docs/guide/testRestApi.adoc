To test REST part of the application, we use https://docs.micronaut.io/snapshot/guide/index.html#httpClient[Micronaut's HttpClient]. We need to add the dependency:

[source,groovy]
./build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tags=micronaut]
----

Micronaut HTTP client makes easy to bind JSON Payloads to POGOs. Create several POGOs which we will use in the test:

[source,groovy]
./src/integration-test/groovy/example/grails/BearerToken.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/integration-test/groovy/example/grails/BearerToken.groovy[indent=0]
----

[source,groovy]
./src/integration-test/groovy/example/grails/CustomError.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/integration-test/groovy/example/grails/CustomError.groovy[indent=0]
----

[source,groovy]
./src/integration-test/groovy/example/grails/UserCredentials.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/integration-test/groovy/example/grails/UserCredentials.groovy[indent=0]
----

Our first test will verify that the _/api/announcements_ endpoint is only accessible to users with role _ROLE_BOSS_.


[source,groovy]
./src/integration-test/groovy/example/grails/ApiAnnouncementControllerSpec.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/integration-test/groovy/example/grails/ApiAnnouncementControllerSpec.groovy[indent=0]
----

<1> The `grails.testing.spock.OnceBefore` annotation is a shorthand way of accomplishing the same behavior that would be accomplished by applying both the `@RunOnce` and `@Before` annotations to a fixture method.
<2> _serverPort_ property is automatically injected and it contains the random port where the app will be running for the functional test.
<3> With Micronaut HTTP client you can bind POJOs to the response body easily.
<4> The server returns a 401, indicating that the resource is secured.
<5> Call the authentication endpoint
<6> We pass the _access_token_ we obtained from the authentication endpoint in the request headers.
<7> An authenticated user with the role `ROLE_BOSS` can access the resource.
<8> An authenticated user but without the role `ROLE_BOSS` is not allowed to access the resource.
