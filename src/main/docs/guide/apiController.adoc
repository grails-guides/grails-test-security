To create the `Announcement` API controller we'll use the http://docs.grails.org/latest/ref/Command%20Line/create-controller.html[create-controller command]
[source, bash]
----
./grailsw create-controller ApiAnnouncement
Created grails-app/controllers/grails/test/security/ApiAnnouncementController.groovy
| Created src/test/groovy/grails/test/security/ApiAnnouncementControllerSpec.groovy
----

We want this controller to handle any requests to _/api/announcements_. We'll need to add the following line to our `UrlMappings`.

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/controllers/grails/test/security/UrlMappings.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/grails/test/security/UrlMappings.groovy[indent=0,lines="12"]
----

The controller will be a http://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/webServices.html#extendingRestfulController[RestfulController], and will only respond with JSON.

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/controllers/grails/test/security/ApiAnnouncementController.groovy
